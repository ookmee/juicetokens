# JuiceTokens Foundation Layer

The Foundation Layer is the first layer of the JuiceTokens protocol, providing essential hardware abstraction and persistence management capabilities. This layer ensures that the protocol can operate consistently across different platforms while maintaining security and reliability.

## Components

### 1. Hardware Abstraction Layer

#### 1.1 TEE Integration Interface
The Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) Integration Interface provides a secure environment for cryptographic operations and key storage. It includes:

- **SecureKeyStorage**: Manages cryptographic keys within the TEE
- **CryptographicOperationRequest/Response**: Handles cryptographic operations
- **AttestationVerificationRequest/Response**: Verifies TEE attestations

#### 1.2 Device Capability Discovery
Provides information about available hardware capabilities:

- **DeviceCapabilities**: Overall device capabilities
- **CommunicationInterface**: Available communication methods
- **StorageCapability**: Storage capabilities
- **CryptographicSupport**: Cryptographic hardware support

#### 1.3 Time Source Management
Ensures reliable time references:

- **TimeSource**: Individual time sources
- **TimeConsensus**: Aggregated time from multiple sources
- **TimeConfidence**: Confidence metrics for time sources
- **SpoofingDetectionResult**: Time spoofing detection

### 2. Persistence Management

#### 2.1 Local Storage Module
Manages local token storage:

- **TokenStore**: Collection of tokens
- **TokenEntry**: Individual token storage
- **StorageOperation/Result**: Storage operations
- **StorageCapacity**: Storage capacity information

#### 2.2 Distributed Hash Table Interface
Provides distributed content-addressable storage:

- **DHTEntry**: DHT entries
- **DHTQuery/QueryResult**: DHT operations
- **S2CellReference**: Geospatial indexing

#### 2.3 Synchronization Primitives
Manages data consistency:

- **VectorClock**: Logical timestamps
- **ConflictResolutionRequest**: Conflict resolution
- **MerkleDifference**: Data set differences
- **SynchronizationSession**: Sync operations

## Implementation Guidelines

### Security Considerations
1. All cryptographic operations should be performed within the TEE
2. Time sources should be validated and aggregated
3. Storage operations should be encrypted
4. DHT operations should be authenticated

### Performance Considerations
1. Use hardware acceleration when available
2. Implement efficient storage strategies
3. Optimize synchronization operations
4. Cache frequently accessed data

### Platform Compatibility
1. Support multiple TEE implementations
2. Adapt to different storage capabilities
3. Handle various communication interfaces
4. Support different time sources

## Usage Examples

### TEE Operations
```protobuf
// Example: Performing a cryptographic operation
CryptographicOperationRequest request {
    operation_type: "SIGN",
    key_id: "key123",
    input_data: <data>,
    parameters: {
        "algorithm": "ECDSA",
        "curve": "P-256"
    }
}
```

### Storage Operations
```protobuf
// Example: Storing a token
StorageOperation operation {
    operation_type: "STORE",
    store_id: "store123",
    operation_data: <token_data>,
    parameters: {
        "encryption": "AES-256-GCM"
    }
}
```

### Synchronization
```protobuf
// Example: Creating a sync session
SynchronizationSession session {
    session_id: "sync123",
    state: "INITIALIZING",
    participants: ["peer1", "peer2"],
    vector_clock: {
        node_id: "local",
        entries: {
            "peer1": 1,
            "peer2": 1
        }
    }
}
```
