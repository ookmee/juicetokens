# JuiceTokens UI Integration Points

This document identifies the components within the JuiceTokens protocol that require user interface elements and those that can remain headless (operating without direct user interaction).

## Layer Relationship Clarification

JuiceTokens is structured around seven distinct layers in both its protocol (back-end) and UI (front-end) aspects. Each protocol layer has corresponding UI integration points that expose its functionality to users. These layers expand from a basic foundation to more complex features:

1. Foundation Layer: Core infrastructure
2. Transport Layer: Communication protocols
3. Core Token Layer: Value representation
4. Trust and Attestation Layer: Reputation framework
5. Token Lifecycle Layer: Temporal value management
6. Extension Layer: Application integration points
7. Governance Layer: System evolution framework

The first five layers form the essential core functionality required for initial implementation and testing. These layers are fully specified and structured.

Layers 6 and 7 are intentionally defined with minimal specifications, as they primarily serve as integration points for extensions and system evolution. These upper layers are designed to allow for creative expansion by users and developers, rather than being fully prescribed from the start.

## UI Progressive Disclosure Framework

Based on the seven developmental stages outlined in the JuiceTokens philosophy, the UI should implement progressive disclosure. This framework aligns with the seven-layer architectural approach, with the UI progressively revealing more advanced capabilities as users develop through the stages.

**Note on Implementation:** The seven developmental stages serve as a philosophical guideline rather than explicit UI navigation states. In practice:
- Elements for stages 1-5 are generally present in the UI from the start, though some may be greyed out or inactive until unlocked
- Features for stages 6-7 are implemented primarily as extensions
- Progression through stages happens organically in the background without requiring users to explicitly navigate between stage-specific interfaces
- This progression model operates orthogonally to the main UI layout structure (ID/Settings, Advertisement Feed, Core Actions, Proximity Awareness)

### Stage 1: Trust - Basic UI
- Simple token display
- Easy transaction interface
- Minimal options
- Clear feedback
- Trust-building visualizations

### Stage 2: Autonomy - Controls UI
- Settings and preferences
- Privacy controls
- Connection management
- Profile customization

### Stage 3: Imagination - Exploration UI
- Sandbox environments
- Suggested usage scenarios
- Creative token applications
- Discovery features

### Stage 4: Competence - Power User UI
- Advanced token management
- Detailed transaction controls
- Analytics and patterns
- Optimization recommendations

### Stage 5: Identity - Reputation UI
- Identity management
- Reputation visualization
- Context-specific profiles
- Attestation networks

### Stage 6: Connection - Community UI
- Group interfaces
- Shared workspaces
- Trust visualization
- Collective decision-making

### Stage 7: Generativity - Creation UI
- Token issuance controls
- Future value creation
- Governance participation
- Impact visualization

## UI Implementation Guidelines

1. **Layer Separation**:
   - Maintain clear separation between UI layer and protocol layers
   - Use event-based communication between UI and protocol components
   - Implement adapter pattern for connecting UI to protocol

2. **Progressive Enhancement**:
   - Start with basic UI for critical functions
   - Add complexity gradually as users progress through developmental stages
   - Allow users to choose complexity level

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Accommodate both native app and PWA contexts
   - Design for multiple device types (mobile, tablet, desktop)
   - Consider offline-first usage patterns

4. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all UI components meet accessibility standards
   - Provide alternative interaction methods
   - Consider crisis scenarios and environmental constraints

5. **Testability**:
   - Build UI components that can be tested independently
   - Implement headless mode for automated testing
   - Create simulation capabilities for UI testing

6. **Development Approach**:
   - Implement core headless components first
   - Add minimal UI for testing and development
   - Expand UI capabilities in alignment with developmental stages
   - Allow UI to be swapped or customized without affecting core protocol

*Note: While primarily headless, Time Source Management is a critical dependency for transaction finalization. Users may be able to prepare transactions but will be unable to finalize them if time integrity requirements are not met. The UI must clearly communicate these dependencies when they affect core functionality.*
